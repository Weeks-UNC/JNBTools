RNAvigate (RNA vizualization and graphical analysis toolset)
==============================================================================
RNAvigate provides a framework for rapidly exploring interrelationships between
chemical probing data, RNA structures, and motif annotations for multiple
experimental samples within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

  * .cif and .pdbx formats

Plot types
----------
* skyline profile plots
* profile linear regression plots
* arc plots
* circle plots
* secondary structure diagrams
* interactive 3-D molecules
* heatmaps with structure contour maps
* ShapeMapper profile plots
* ShapeMapper quality control plots
* 3D distance distributions
* Annotations on arc and secondary structure
* Profile, windowed shape and shannon, arcplot (classic)
* Forthcoming:
  * Annotations on skyline, circle, and 3D structure

Analyses
--------
* Log Compare Ã  la Steve

Other features
--------------
* Filtering data on many parameters
* Calculating 3D distance and contact distances
* Automatic data alignment for comparing sequence variants

General notes
-------------
* PDB format can be picky, and there are mistakes in some files from the PDB.
* When creating many plots, it may boost performance to run `plt.close('all')`.
