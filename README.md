RNAvigate (RNA visualization and graphical analysis toolset)
==============================================================================

RNAvigate provides a framework to explore and compare chemical probing data,
RNA structures, and motif annotations between experimental samples.
It is useful for scripting, but is most powerful in a Jupyter Notebook.

RNAvigate uses Python, but the high-level interface is designed to be easy to
learn for non-programmers. The low-level API is also very useful for Python developers.
