| Read depth check:
| 99.7% (2918/2928) nucleotides meet the minimum read depth of 100
| PASS
| 
| Mutation rate check:
| 40.6% (1185/2918) nucleotides have positive mutation rates
| above background
| FAIL: Mutation rates do not show a clear difference between
|       modified and untreated samples.
|       Possible causes:
|        - DNA contamination
|        - poor mixing of chemical reagents and RNA and/or poor
|          reagent diffusion (if modifying in cells), resulting
|          in low modification rates
|        - expired reagents, resulting in low modification rates
|        - poor reverse transcription conditions, resulting in
|          low adduct read-through
|        - extremely highly structured RNA
| 
| High background check:
| 0.3% (10/2918) nucleotides have high background
| mutation rates.
| PASS: Not too many nucleotides with high background mutation rates.
| 
| Number highly reactive check:
| 0.4% (12/2918) nucleotides show high apparent reactivity.
