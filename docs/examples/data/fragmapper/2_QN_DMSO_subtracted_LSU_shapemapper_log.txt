| Number highly reactive check:
| 1.8% (52/2915) nucleotides show high apparent reactivity.
| FAIL
|       Possible causes:
|        - DNA contamination
|        - poor mixing of chemical reagents and RNA and/or poor
|          reagent diffusion (if modifying in cells), resulting
|          in low modification rates
|        - expired reagents, resulting in low modification rates
|        - poor reverse transcription conditions, resulting in
|          low adduct read-through
|        - extremely highly structured RNA
