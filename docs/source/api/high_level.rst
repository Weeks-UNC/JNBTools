High-level API
==============

This documentation includes the high-level API of the rnavigate package.
Most users will only need to use the functions and classes in this module.

This includes the sample creation function ``rnav.Sample()`` which allows the user
to load input data files and organize them. The user can then use the plotting
functions by providing the sample objects and data keywords as inputs.

See :doc:`/get_started/loading_data` and :doc:`/get_started/visualizing_data` for more information.
